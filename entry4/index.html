                    My reason to live is One Piece. I wanna finish One Piece, and it’s so long I have to stay alive to finish it. I just love One Piece. It’s very nostalgic for me because I started watching in grade four, so I've been a fan for a long time. Recently though I must say I have not been very caught up because you know, busy times. But one piece makes me happy. And sometimes I'll go back and rewatch certain parts and it's always a great time. I would highly recommend, and anyone who says otherwise is wrong.

                I remember when the only reason I could get through everyday at some point in high school was because I knew was going to watch Suits at the end of the day and I was invested, and I cared about those characters. I did the same thing with the Heroes of Olympus series. I wasn't feeling too good but I really wanted to know what was going to happen, so I got through everything else so I could keep reading.

                Shameless, The Good Place, Just Add Magic, This Is Us, Backstage, Suits, so much more. I get really attached to the characters, and I think it helps me to have a constant to look forward to always. Go find a show to watch for a while, LOL. The longer the better. At least 9 seasons.
