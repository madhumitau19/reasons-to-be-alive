            I can’t entirely pin down my favorite memory of all time, but one that definitely brings back a lot of sweet memories would be when Eva, Madhu, and I went to this one place where you can buy chai and sit down on rugs and cushions. I think it was the simplicity of it all: how something as small as tea can bring so many giggles out of you. We just sat there for so long, complaining about Hinge men, random class tidbits, this one couple who was committing insane levels of PDA, and whatever else. Either way, it was a moment of respite tucked into an otherwise restless schedule.

            Me and my middle sister, when it was my senior year of high school and her last year of college, we would have movie nights in the living room and and cook together when we could because it was gonna be our last time living together for a while. It was really fun, it brought me joy. We watched many romcoms.

            I visited some friends in Montreal over the winter break and we went to Haidilao and it happened to be their, I think, one year anniversary. So they had a bunch of like free raffles going on and we got Haidilao scrunchies for announcing the raffles, but we didn't win any of the fucking meat— but it's okay And it's just really fun. I ate a lot. It was really good food. Louie got a free charm for some reason. I forget what he did. I think he, like, volunteered again. And the table of white people beside us won free Wagyu beef? Yeah, I went to Haidilao sooo many times last summer.
